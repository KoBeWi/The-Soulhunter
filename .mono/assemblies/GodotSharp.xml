            <summary>
            Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.
            A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instanced into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.
            [b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i.e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.
            Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the NOTIFICATION_READY notification and their respective [method _ready] callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent nodes.
            This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method _enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally [method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).
            [b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the "process" state, so that they receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.
            Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the [method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.
            To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into other scenes), an "owner" can be set for the node with the [member owner] property. This keeps track of who instanced what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.
            Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method queue_free], it will also free all its children.
            [b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could create groups like "enemies" or "collectables" for example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on [SceneTree].
            [b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, see [NetworkedMultiplayerENet]) it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling [method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which node receives the RPC call Godot will use its [NodePath] (make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.

            <summary>
            Base class for all non built-in types. Everything which is not a built-in type starts the inheritance chain from this class.
            Objects can be constructed from scripting languages, using [code]Object.new()[/code] in GDScript, [code]new Object[/code] in C#, or the "Construct Object" node in VisualScript.
            Objects do not manage memory, if inheriting from one the object will most likely have to be deleted manually (call the [method free] function from the script or delete from C++).
            Some derivatives add memory management, such as [Reference] (which keeps a reference count and deletes itself automatically when no longer referenced) and [Node], which deletes the children tree when deleted.
            Objects export properties, which are mainly useful for storage and editing, but not really so much in programming. Properties are exported in [method _get_property_list] and handled in [method _get] and [method _set]. However, scripting languages and C++ have simpler means to export them.
            Objects also receive notifications ([method _notification]). Notifications are a simple way to notify the object about simple events, so they can all be handled together.

            Note: Some nodes derived from this class can have a different default value, and potentially their own built-in logic overriding this setting. For example [FileDialog] defaults to [code]false[/code], and has its own input validation code that is called when you press OK, which eventually hides the dialog if the input is valid. As such this property can't be used in [FileDialog] to disable hiding the dialog when pressing OK.

            [code]AnimatedTexture[/code] is a resource format for simple frame-based animations, where multiple frames textures can be chained automatically with a predefined delay for each frame. It's not a [Node], contrarily to [AnimationPlayer] or [AnimatedSprite], but has the advantage of being usable at any place where a [Texture] resource can be used, e.g. in a [TileSet].
            The playback of the animation is controlled by the [member fps] property as well as each frame's optional delay (see [method set_frame_delay]). The animation loops, i.e. it will restart at frame 0 automatically after playing the last frame.
            [code]AnimatedTexture[/code] currently requires all frame textures to have the same size, otherwise the bigger ones will be cropped to match the smallest one.

No index can be beyond the vertex array size. When this index array is present, it puts the function into "index mode," where the index selects the *i*'th vertex, normal, tangent, color, UV, etc. This means if you want to have different normals or colors along an edge, you have to duplicate the vertices.
            For triangles, the index array is interpreted as triples, referring to the vertices of each triangle. For lines, the index array is in pairs indicating the start and end of each line.

            <summary>
            The ARVR Anchor point is a spatial node that maps a real world location identified by the AR platform to a position within the game world. For example, as long as plane detection in ARKit is on, ARKit will identify and update the position of planes (tables, floors, etc) and create anchors for them.
            This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique id. When you receive a signal that a new anchor is available, you should add this node to your scene for that anchor. You can predefine nodes and set the id and the nodes will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognised.
            Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing and orientation of an anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns more about the real world out there especially if only part of the surface is in view.

The most common situation where anchors 'disappear' is when the AR server identifies that two anchors represent different parts of the same plane and merges them.

            The position and orientation of this node is automatically updated by the ARVR Server to represent the location of the HMD if such tracking is available and can thus be used by game logic. Note that, in contrast to the ARVR Controller, the render thread has access to the most up-to-date tracking data of the HMD and the location of the ARVRCamera can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering as a result.

            This is a helper spatial node that is linked to the tracking of controllers. It also offers several handy passthroughs to the state of buttons and such on the controllers.
            Controllers are linked by their id. You can create controller nodes before the controllers are available. Say your game always uses two controllers (one for each hand) you can predefine the controllers with id 1 and 2 and they will become active as soon as the controllers are identified. If you expect additional controllers to be used, you should react to the signals and add ARVRController nodes to your scene.
            The position of the controller node is automatically updated by the ARVR Server. This makes this node ideal to add child nodes to visualise the controller.

            For any other controller that the [ARVRServer] detects, we continue with controller id 3.
            When a controller is turned off, its slot is freed. This ensures controllers will keep the same id even when controllers with lower ids are turned off.

            After initializing the interface you want to use you then need to enable the AR/VR mode of a viewport and rendering should commence.
            Note that you must enable the AR/VR mode on the main viewport for any device that uses the main output of Godot such as for mobile VR.
            If you do this for a platform that handles its own output (such as OpenVR) Godot will show just one eye without distortion on screen. Alternatively you can add a separate viewport node to your scene and enable AR/VR on that viewport and it will be used to output to the HMD leaving you free to do anything you like in the main window such as using a separate camera as a spectator camera or render out something completely different.
            While currently not used you can activate additional interfaces, you may wish to do this if you want to track controllers from other platforms. However at this point in time only one interface can render to an HMD.

            As controllers are turned on and the AR/VR interface detects them instances of this object are automatically added to this list of active tracking objects accessible through the ARVRServer
            The ARVRController and ARVRAnchor both consume objects of this type and should be the objects you use in game. The positional trackers are just the under the hood objects that make this all work and are mostly exposed so GDNative based interfaces can interact with them.

            This is a really important function to understand correctly. AR and VR platforms all handle positioning slightly differently.
            For platforms that do not offer spatial tracking our origin point (0,0,0) is the location of our HMD but you have little control over the direction the player is facing in the real world.
            For platforms that do offer spatial tracking our origin point depends very much on the system. For OpenVR our origin point is usually the center of the tracking space, on the ground. For other platforms its often the location of the tracking camera.
            This method allows you to center our tracker on the location of the HMD, it will take the current location of the HMD and use that to adjust all our tracking data in essence realigning the real world to your players current position in your game world.
            For this method to produce usable results tracking information should be available and this often takes a few frames after starting your game.
            You should call this method after a few seconds have passed, when the user requests a realignment of the display holding a designated button on a controller for a short period of time, and when implementing a teleport mechanism.

            A* (A star) is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points. It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation make use of vectors as points.
            You must add points manually with [method AStar.add_point] and create segments manually with [method AStar.connect_points]. So you can test if there is a path between two points with the [method AStar.are_points_connected] function, get the list of existing ids in the found path with [method AStar.get_id_path], or the points list with [method AStar.get_point_path].

            Dynamic range compressor reduces the level of the sound when the amplitude goes over a certain threshold in Decibels. One of the main uses of a compressor is to increase the dynamic range by clipping as little as possible (when sound goes over 0dB).
            Compressor has many uses in the mix:
            - In the Master bus to compress the whole output (Although a [AudioEffectLimiter] is probably better)
            - In voice channels to ensure they sound as balanced as possible.
            - Sidechained. Sidechained, which can reduce the sound level sidechained with another audio bus for threshold detection.. This technique is very common in video game mixing to download the level of Music/SFX while voices are being heard.
            - Accentuates transients by using a wider attack, making effects sound more punchy.

            AudioEffectEQ gives you control over frequencies. Use it to compensate for existing deficiencies in audio. AudioEffectEQ are very useful on the Master Bus to completely master a mix and give it character. They are also very useful when a game is run on a mobile device, to adjust the mix to that kind of speakers (it can be added but disabled when headphones are plugged).

            A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to disallow sound going over a given dB threshold. Adding one in the Master Bus is always recommended to reduce the effects of clipping.
            Soft clipping starts to reduce the peaks a little below the threshold level and progressively increases its effect as the input level increases such that the threshold is never exceeded.

            Camera node for 2D scenes. It forces the screen (current layer) to scroll following this node. This makes it easier (and faster) to program scrollable scenes than manually changing the position of [CanvasItem] based nodes.
            This node is intended to be a simple helper to get things going quickly and it may happen often that more functionality is desired to change how the camera works. To make your own custom camera node, simply inherit from [Node2D] and change the transform of the canvas by calling get_viewport().set_canvas_transform(m) in [Viewport].

            <summary>
            Base class of anything 2D. Canvas items are laid out in a tree and children inherit and extend the transform of their parent. CanvasItem is extended by [Control], for anything GUI related, and by [Node2D] for anything 2D engine related.
            Any CanvasItem can draw. For this, the "update" function must be called, then NOTIFICATION_DRAW will be received on idle time to request redraw. Because of this, canvas items don't need to be redraw on every frame, improving the performance significantly. Several functions for drawing on the CanvasItem are provided (see draw_* functions). They can only be used inside the notification, signal or _draw() overrides function, though.
            Canvas items are draw in tree order. By default, children are on top of their parents so a root CanvasItem will be drawn behind everything (this can be changed per item though).
            Canvas items can also be hidden (hiding also their subtree). They provide many means for changing standard parameters such as opacity (for it and the subtree) and self opacity, blend mode.
            Ultimately, a transform notification can be requested, which will notify the node that its global position changed in case the parent tree changed.

            <summary>
            Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics. It is made out of segments and is very optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. It is really not advised to use for [RigidBody2D] nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions.
            The main difference between a [ConvexPolygonShape2D] and a [code]ConcavePolygonShape2D[/code] is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.

            This helper class can be used to store [Variant] values on the filesystem using INI-style formatting. The stored values are identified by a section and a key:
            [codeblock]
            [section]
            some_key=42
            string_example="Hello World!"
            a_vector=Vector3( 1, 0, 2 )
            [/codeblock]
            The stored data can be saved to or parsed from a file, though ConfigFile objects can also be used directly without accessing the filesystem.
            The following example shows how to parse an INI-style file from the system, read its contents and store new values in it:
            [codeblock]
            var config = ConfigFile.new()
            var err = config.load("user://settings.cfg")
            if err == OK: # if not, something went wrong with the file loading
            # Look for the display/width pair, and default to 1024 if missing
            var screen_width = config.get_value("display", "width", 1024)
            # Store a variable if and only if it hasn't been defined yet
            if not config.has_section_key("audio", "mute"):
            config.set_value("audio", "mute", false)
            # Save the changes by overwriting the previous file
            config.save("user://settings.cfg")
            [/codeblock]
            Keep in mind that section and property names can't contain spaces. Anything after a space will be ignored on save and on load.

        <member name="T:Godot.Control">
            <summary>
            Base class for all User Interface or [i]UI[/i] related nodes. [code]Control[/code] features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent and margins that represent an offset to the anchor. The margins update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change.
            For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, margins, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from [code]Control[/code] and [Container] nodes.
            [b]User Interface nodes and input[/b]
            Godot sends input events to the scene's root node first, by calling [method Node._input]. [method Node._input] forwards the event down the node tree to the nodes under the mouse cursor, or on keyboard focus. To do so, it calls [method MainLoop._input_event]. Call [method accept_event] so no other node receives the event. Once you accepted an input, it becomes handled so [method Node._unhandled_input] will not process it.
            Only one [code]Control[/code] node can be in keyboard focus. Only the node in focus will receive keyboard events. To get the focus, call [method grab_focus]. [code]Control[/code] nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus.
            Set [member mouse_filter] to [constant MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE] to tell a [code]Control[/code] node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button.
            [Theme] resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the [Theme] on a [code]Control[/code] node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the [code]add_*_override[/code] methods, like [method add_font_override]. You can override the theme with the inspector.

            Convex Polygon Shape for 2D physics. A convex polygon, whatever its shape, is internally decomposed into as many convex polygons as needed to ensure all collision checks against it are always done on convex polygons (which are faster to check).
            The main difference between a [code]ConvexPolygonShape2D[/code] and a [ConcavePolygonShape2D] is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.

The node encapsulates the result of the CSG operations of its children. In this way, it is possible to do operations on one set of shapes that are children of one CSGCombiner node, and a set of separate operations on a second set of shapes that are children of a second CSGCombiner node, and then do an operation that takes the two end results as its input to create the final shape.

            DynamicFont renders vector font files (such as TTF or OTF) dynamically at runtime instead of using a prerendered texture atlas like [BitmapFont]. This trades the faster loading time of [BitmapFont]s for the ability to change font parameters like size and spacing during runtime. [DynamicFontData] is used for referencing the font file paths.

        <member name="T:Godot.HTTPClient">
            <summary>
            Hyper-text transfer protocol client (sometimes called "User Agent"). Used to make HTTP requests to download web content, upload files and other data or to communicate with various services, among other use cases.
            Note that this client only needs to connect to a host once (see [method connect_to_host]) to send multiple requests. Because of this, methods that take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full URL, as the client is already connected to a host. See [method request] for a full example and to get started.
            A [code]HTTPClient[/code] should be reused between multiple requests or to connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request. Supports SSL and SSL server certificate verification. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success, 3xx redirection (i.e. "try again, but over here"), 4xx something was wrong with the request, and 5xx something went wrong on the server's side.
            For more information on HTTP, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP (or read RFC 2616 to get it straight from the source: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).

            Performs bilinear separately on the two most suited mipmap levels, then linearly interpolates between them.
            It's slower than [code]INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR[/code], but produces higher quality results, with much less aliasing artifacts.
            If the image does not have mipmaps, they will be generated and used internally, but no mipmaps will be generated on the resulting image. (Note that if you intend to scale multiple copies of the original image, it's better to call [code]generate_mipmaps[/code] on it in advance, to avoid wasting processing power in generating them again and again.)
            On the other hand, if the image already has mipmaps, they will be used, and a new set will be generated for the resulting image.

            Turning on the option [b]Load As Placeholder[/b] for an instanced scene in the editor causes it to be replaced by an InstancePlaceholder when running the game. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene until calling [method replace_by_instance]. This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading parts of it selectively.
            The InstancePlaceholder does not have a transform. This causes any child nodes to be positioned relatively to the Viewport from point (0,0), rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children relatively to their parent again.

            Kinematic bodies are special types of bodies that are meant to be user-controlled. They are not affected by physics at all (to other types of bodies, such a character or a rigid body, these are the same as a static body). They have however, two main uses:
            Simulated Motion: When these bodies are moved manually, either from code or from an AnimationPlayer (with process mode set to fixed), the physics will automatically compute an estimate of their linear and angular velocity. This makes them very useful for moving platforms or other AnimationPlayer-controlled objects (like a door, a bridge that opens, etc).
            Kinematic Characters: KinematicBody also has an API for moving objects (the [method move_and_collide] and [method move_and_slide] methods) while performing collision tests. This makes them really useful to implement characters that collide against a world, but that don't require advanced physics.

            <summary>
            Moves the body along a vector. If the body collides with another, it will slide along the other body rather than stop immediately. If the other body is a [code]KinematicBody[/code] or [RigidBody], it will also be affected by the motion of the other body. You can use this to make moving or rotating platforms, or to make nodes push other nodes.
            [code]linear_velocity[/code] is the velocity vector (typically meters per second). Unlike in [method move_and_collide], you should [i]not[/i] multiply it by [code]delta[/code] — the physics engine handles applying the velocity.
            [code]floor_normal[/code] is the up direction, used to determine what is a wall and what is a floor or a ceiling. If set to the default value of [code]Vector3(0, 0, 0)[/code], everything is considered a wall. This is useful for topdown games.
            If the body is standing on a slope and the horizontal speed (relative to the floor's speed) goes below [code]slope_stop_min_velocity[/code], the body will stop completely. This prevents the body from sliding down slopes when you include gravity in [code]linear_velocity[/code]. When set to lower values, the body will not be able to stand still on steep slopes.
            If the body collides, it will change direction a maximum of [code]max_slides[/code] times before it stops.
            [code]floor_max_angle[/code] is the maximum angle (in radians) where a slope is still considered a floor (or a ceiling), rather than a wall. The default value equals 45 degrees.
            Returns the movement that remained when the body stopped. To get more detailed information about collisions that occurred, use [method get_slide_collision].

            Label displays plain text on the screen. It gives you control over the horizontal and vertical alignment, and can wrap the text inside the node's bounding rectangle. It doesn't support bold, italics or other formatting. For that, use [RichTextLabel] instead.
            Note that contrarily to most other [Control]s, Label's [member Control.mouse_filter] defaults to MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE (i.e. it doesn't react to mouse input events). This implies that a label won't display any configured [member Control.hint_tooltip], unless you change its mouse filter.

            Main loop is the abstract main loop base class. All other main loop classes are derived from it. Upon application start, a [code]MainLoop[/code] has to be provided to OS, else the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneTree] is created), unless a main [Script] is supplied, which may or not create and return a [code]MainLoop[/code].

            The MeshDataTool provides access to individual vertices in a [Mesh]. It allows users to read and edit vertex data of meshes. It also creates an array of faces and edges.
            To use the MeshDataTool, load a mesh with [method create_from_surface]. When you are finished editing the data commit the data to a mesh with [method commit_to_surface].
            Below is an example of how the MeshDataTool may be used.
            [codeblock]
            var mdt = MeshDataTool.new()

This is the class most often used to get 3D geometry rendered and can be used to instance a single [Mesh] in many places. This allows to reuse geometry and save on resources.

            This is a generic mobile VR implementation where you need to provide details about the phone and HMD used. It does not rely on any existing framework. This is the most basic interface we have. For the best effect you do need a mobile phone with a gyroscope and accelerometer.
            Note that even though there is no positional tracking the camera will assume the headset is at a height of 1.85 meters.

            <summary>
            MultiMesh provides low level mesh instancing. Drawing thousands of [MeshInstance] nodes can be slow because each object is submitted to the GPU to be drawn individually.
            MultiMesh is much faster because it can draw thousands of instances with a single draw call, resulting in less API overhead.
            As a drawback, if the instances are too far away of each other, performance may be reduced as every single instance will always rendered (they are spatially indexed as one, for the whole object).
            Since instances may have any behavior, the AABB used for visibility must be provided by the user.

The given address needs to be either a fully qualified domain name (e.g. [code]www.example.com[/code]) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6 format (e.g. [code]192.168.1.1[/code]). The [code]port[/code] is the port the server is listening on. The [code]in_bandwidth[/code] and [code]out_bandwidth[/code] parameters can be used to limit the incoming and outgoing bandwidth to the given number of bytes per second. The default of 0 means unlimited bandwidth. Note that ENet will strategically drop packets on specific sides of a connection between peers to ensure the peer's bandwidth is not overwhelmed. The bandwidth parameters also determine the window size of a connection which limits the amount of reliable packets that may be in transit at any given time. Returns [code]OK[/code] if a client was created, [code]ERR_ALREADY_IN_USE[/code] if this NetworkedMultiplayerEnet instance already has an open connection (in which case you need to call [method close_connection] first) or [code]ERR_CANT_CREATE[/code] if the client could not be created. If [code]client_port[/code] is specified, the client will also listen to the given port, this is useful in some NAT traversal technique.

        <member name="M:Godot.OS.Execute(System.String,System.String[],System.Boolean,Godot.Collections.Array)">
            <summary>
            Execute the file at the given path with the arguments passed as an array of strings. Platform path resolution will take place. The resolved file must exist and be executable.
            The arguments are used in the given order and separated by a space, so [code]OS.execute('ping', ['-w', '3', 'godotengine.org'], false)[/code] will resolve to [code]ping -w 3 godotengine.org[/code] in the system's shell.
            This method has slightly different behaviour based on whether the [code]blocking[/code] mode is enabled.
            When [code]blocking[/code] is enabled, the Godot thread will pause its execution while waiting for the process to terminate. The shell output of the process will be written to the [code]output[/code] array as a single string. When the process terminates, the Godot thread will resume execution.
            When [code]blocking[/code] is disabled, the Godot thread will continue while the new process runs. It is not possible to retrieve the shell output in non-blocking mode, so [code]output[/code] will be empty.
            The return value also depends on the blocking mode. When blocking, the method will return -2 (no process ID information is available in blocking mode). When non-blocking, the method returns a process ID, which you can use to monitor the process (and potentially terminate it with [method kill]). If the process forking (non-blocking) or opening (blocking) fails, the method will return -1.
            Example of blocking mode and retrieving the shell output:
            [codeblock]
            var output = []
            OS.execute('ls', ['-l', '/tmp'], true, output)
            [/codeblock]
            Example of non-blocking mode, running another instance of the project and storing its process ID:
            [codeblock]
            var pid = OS.execute(OS.get_executable_path(), [], false)
            [/codeblock]
            If you wish to access a shell built-in or perform a composite command, a platform-specific shell can be invoked. For example:
            [codeblock]
            OS.execute('CMD.exe', ['/C', 'cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; dir'], true, output)
            [/codeblock]
            &lt;param name="output"&gt;If the param is null, then the default value is new Godot.Collections.Array {}&lt;/param&gt;

        <member name="M:Godot.OS.Kill(System.Int32)">

            A simplified interface to a scene file. Provides access to operations and checks that can be performed on the scene resource itself.
            Can be used to save a node to a file. When saving, the node as well as all the node it owns get saved (see [code]owner[/code] property on [Node]). Note that the node doesn't need to own itself.
            Example of saving a node with different owners: The following example creates 3 objects: [code]Node2D[/code] ([code]node[/code]), [code]RigidBody2D[/code] ([code]rigid[/code]) and [code]CollisionObject2D[/code] ([code]collision[/code]). [code]collision[/code] is a child of [code]rigid[/code] which is a child of [code]node[/code]. Only [code]rigid[/code] is owned by [code]node[/code] and [code]pack[/code] will therefore only save those two nodes, but not [code]collision[/code].

            ParticlesMaterial defines particle properties and behavior. It is used in the [code]process_material[/code] of [Particles] and [Particles2D] emitter nodes.
            Some of this material's properties are applied to each particle when emitted, while others can have a [CurveTexture] applied to vary values over the lifetime of the particle.
            When a randomness ratio is applied to a property it is used to scale that property by a random amount. The random ratio is used to interpolate between [code]1.0[/code] and a random number less than one, the result is multiplied by the property to obtain the randomized property. For example a random ratio of [code]0.4[/code] would scale the original property between [code]0.4-1.0[/code] of its original value.

            This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the [i]Monitor[/i] tab in the editor's [i]Debugger[/i] panel. By using the [method get_monitor] method of this class, you can access this data from your code. Note that a few of these monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return 0 when used in a release build.
            Many of these monitors are not updated in real-time, so there may be a short delay between changes.

            <summary>
            ProceduralSky provides a way to create an effective background quickly by defining procedural parameters for the sun, the sky and the ground. The sky and ground are very similar, they are defined by a color at the horizon, another color, and finally an easing curve to interpolate between these two colors. Similarly the sun is described by a position in the sky, a color, and an easing curve. However, the sun also defines a minimum and maximum angle, these two values define at what distance the easing curve begins and ends from the sun, and thus end up defining the size of the sun in the sky.
            The ProceduralSky is updated on the CPU after the parameters change and stored in a texture and then displayed as a background in the scene. This makes it relatively unsuitable for realtime updates during gameplay. But with a small texture size it is still feasible to update relatively frequently because it is updated on a background thread when multi-threading is available.

            A RayCast represents a line from its origin to its destination position, [code]cast_to[/code]. It is used to query the 3D space in order to find the closest object along the path of the ray.
            RayCast can ignore some objects by adding them to the exception list via [code]add_exception[/code], by setting proper filtering with collision layers, or by filtering object types with type masks.
            RayCast can be configured to report collisions with [Area]s ([member collide_with_areas]) and/or [PhysicsBody]s ([member collide_with_bodies]).
            Only enabled raycasts will be able to query the space and report collisions.
            RayCast calculates intersection every physics frame (see [Node]), and the result is cached so it can be used later until the next frame. If multiple queries are required between physics frames (or during the same frame) use [method force_raycast_update] after adjusting the raycast.

            <summary>
            Regular Expression (or regex) is a compact programming language that can be used to recognise strings that follow a specific pattern, such as URLs, email addresses, complete sentences, etc. For instance, a regex of [code]ab[0-9][/code] would find any string that is [code]ab[/code] followed by any number from [code]0[/code] to [code]9[/code]. For a more in-depth look, you can easily find various tutorials and detailed explanations on the Internet.
            To begin, the RegEx object needs to be compiled with the search pattern using [method compile] before it can be used.
            [codeblock]
            var regex = RegEx.new()
            regex.compile("\\w-(\\d+)")
            [/codeblock]
            The search pattern must be escaped first for gdscript before it is escaped for the expression. For example, [code]compile("\\d+")[/code] would be read by RegEx as [code]\d+[/code]. Similarly, [code]compile("\"(?:\\\\.|[^\"])*\"")[/code] would be read as [code]"(?:\\.|[^"])*"[/code]
            Using [method search] you can find the pattern within the given text. If a pattern is found, [RegExMatch] is returned and you can retrieve details of the results using functions such as [method RegExMatch.get_string] and [method RegExMatch.get_start].
            [codeblock]
            var regex = RegEx.new()
            regex.compile("\\w-(\\d+)")
            var result = regex.search("abc n-0123")
            if result:
            print(result.get_string()) # Would print n-0123
            [/codeblock]
            The results of capturing groups [code]()[/code] can be retrieved by passing the group number to the various functions in [RegExMatch]. Group 0 is the default and would always refer to the entire pattern. In the above example, calling [code]result.get_string(1)[/code] would give you [code]0123[/code].
            This version of RegEx also supports named capturing groups, and the names can be used to retrieve the results. If two or more groups have the same name, the name would only refer to the first one with a match.
            [codeblock]
            var regex = RegEx.new()
            regex.compile("d(?&lt;digit&gt;[0-9]+)|x(?&lt;digit&gt;[0-9a-f]+)")
            var result = regex.search("the number is x2f")
            if result:
            print(result.get_string("digit")) # Would print 2f
            [/codeblock]
            If you need to process multiple results, [method search_all] generates a list of all non-overlapping results. This can be combined with a for-loop for convenience.
            [codeblock]
            for result in regex.search_all("d01, d03, d0c, x3f and x42"):
            print(result.get_string("digit"))
            # Would print 01 03 3f 42
            # Note that d0c would not match
            [/codeblock]

            Resource is the base class for all resource types, serving primarily as data containers. They are reference counted and freed when no longer in use. They are also loaded only once from disk, and further attempts to load the resource will return the same reference (all this in contrast to a [Node], which is not reference counted and can be instanced from disk as many times as desired). Resources can be saved externally on disk or bundled into another object, such as a [Node] or another resource.

            Godot loads resources in the editor or in exported games using ResourceFormatLoaders. They get queried when you call [code]load[/code], or when a resource with internal dependencies is loaded. Each file type may load as a different resource type, so multiple ResourceFormatLoader are registered in the engine.
            Extending this class allows you to define your own. You should give it a global class name with [code]class_name[/code] for it to be registered. You may as well implement a [ResourceFormatSaver].
            Note: You can also extend [EditorImportPlugin] if the resource type you need exists but Godot is unable to load its format. Choosing one way over another depends if the format is suitable or not for the final exported game. Example: it's better to import .PNG textures as .STEX first, so they can be loaded with better efficiency on the graphics card.

            This is the node that implements full 3D physics. This means that you do not control a RigidBody directly. Instead you can apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, collision, bouncing, rotating, etc.
            A RigidBody has 4 behavior [member mode]s: Rigid, Static, Character, and Kinematic.
            [b]Note:[/b] Don't change a RigidBody's position every frame or very often. Sporadic changes work fine, but physics runs at a different granularity (fixed hz) than usual rendering (process callback) and maybe even in a separate thread, so changing this from a process loop will yield strange behavior. If you need to directly affect the body's state, use [method _integrate_forces], which allows you to directly access the physics state.
            If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration. See [member custom_integrator].

You can also use the SceneTree to organize your nodes into groups: every node can be assigned as many groups as you want to create, e.g. a "enemy" group.

            <summary>
            The peer object to handle the RPC system (effectively enabling networking when set). Depending on the peer itself, the SceneTree will become a network server (check with [method is_network_server]) and will set root node's network mode to master (see NETWORK_MODE_* constants in [Node]), or it will become a regular peer with root node set to puppet. All child nodes are set to inherit the network mode by default. Handling of networking-related events (connection, disconnection, new clients) is done by connecting to SceneTree's signals.

            Skeleton provides a hierarchical interface for managing bones, including pose, rest and animation (see [Animation]). Skeleton will support rag doll dynamics in the future.
            The overall transform of a bone with respect to the skeleton is determined by the following hierarchical order: rest pose, custom pose and pose.
            Note that "global pose" below refers to the overall transform of the bone with respect to skeleton, so it not the actual global/world transform of the bone.

            Note that in the mathematical sense, rotation is a matrix and not a vector. The three Euler angles, which are the three independent parameters of the Euler-angle parametrization of the rotation matrix, are stored in a [Vector3] data structure not because the rotation is a vector, but only because [Vector3] exists as a convenient data-structure to store 3 floating point numbers. Therefore, applying affine operations on the rotation "vector" is not meaningful.

            Static body for 3D physics. A static body is a simple body that is not intended to move. They don't consume any CPU resources in contrast to a [RigidBody] so they are great for scenario collision.
            A static body can also be animated by using simulated motion mode. This is useful for implementing functionalities such as moving platforms. When this mode is active the body can be animated and automatically computes linear and angular velocity to apply in that frame and to influence other bodies.
            Alternatively, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the static body, so even if it doesn't move, it affects other bodies as if it was moving (this is useful for simulating conveyor belts or conveyor wheels).

            [method get_margin] should be used to fetch this value as consumer instead of reading these properties directly. This is because it correctly respects negative values and the fallback mentioned above.

            This stylebox can be used to achieve all kinds of looks without the need of a texture. Those properties are customizable:
            - Color
            - Border width (individual width for each border)
            - Rounded corners (individual radius for each corner)
            - Shadow
            Setting corner radius to high values is allowed. As soon as corners would overlap the stylebox will switch to a relative system. Example:
            [codeblock]
            height = 30
            corner_radius_top_left = 50
            corner_radius_bottom_left = 100
            [/codeblock]
            The relative system now would take the 1:2 ratio of the two left corners to calculate the actual corner width. Both corners added will [b]never[/b] be more than the height. Result:
            [codeblock]
            corner_radius_top_left: 10
            corner_radius_bottom_left: 20

            This sets the amount of vertices used for each corner. Higher values result in rounder corners but take more processing power to compute. When choosing a value you should take the corner radius ([method set_corner_radius_all]) into account.
            For corner radius smaller than 10, 4-5 should be enough.
            For corner radius smaller than 30, 8-12 should be enough.

            The [code]SurfaceTool[/code] is used to construct a [Mesh] by specifying vertex attributes individually. It can be used to construct a [Mesh] from script. All properties except index need to be added before a call to [method add_vertex]. For example adding vertex colors and UVs looks like
            [codeblock]
            var st = SurfaceTool.new()
            st.begin(Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES)
            st.add_color(Color(1, 0, 0))
            st.add_uv(Vector2(0, 0))
            st.add_vertex(Vector3(0, 0, 0))
            [/codeblock]
            The [code]SurfaceTool[/code] now contains one vertex of a triangle which has a UV coordinate and a specified [Color]. If another vertex were added without calls to [method add_uv] or [method add_color] then the last values would be used.
            It is very important that vertex attributes are passed [b]before[/b] the call to [method add_vertex], failure to do this will result in an error when committing the vertex information to a mesh.
            Additionally, the attributes used before the first vertex is added determine the format of the mesh. For example if you only add UVs to the first vertex, you cannot add color to any of the subsequent vertices.

            <summary>
            Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values. The name *tween* comes from *in-betweening*, an animation technique where you specify *keyframes* and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.
            Here is a brief usage example that causes a 2D node to move smoothly between two positions:
            [codeblock]
            var tween = get_node("Tween")
            tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, "position",
            Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,
            Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)
            tween.start()
            [/codeblock]
            Many methods require a property name, such as "position" above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly by using "property:component" (eg. [code]position:x[/code]), where it would only apply to that particular component.
            Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/code]. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [code]http://easings.net/[/code] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls the where [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum TransitionType] constants with [code]EASE_IN_OUT[/code], and use the one that looks best.

            <summary>
            Helper to manage UndoRedo in the editor or custom tools. It works by registering methods and property changes inside 'actions'.
            Common behavior is to create an action, then add do/undo calls to functions or property changes, then committing the action.
            Here's an example on how to add an action to Godot editor's own 'undoredo':
            [codeblock]
            var undo_redo = get_undo_redo() # Method of EditorPlugin.
            func do_something():
            pass # Put your code here.
            func undo_something():
            pass # Put here the code that reverts what's done by "do_something()".
            func _on_MyButton_pressed():
            var node = get_node("MyNode2D")
            undo_redo.create_action("Move the node")
            undo_redo.add_do_method(self, "do_something")
            undo_redo.add_undo_method(self, "undo_something")
            undo_redo.add_do_property(node, "position", Vector2(100,100))
            undo_redo.add_undo_property(node, "position", node.position)
            undo_redo.commit_action()
            [/codeblock]
            [method create_action], [method add_do_method], [method add_undo_method], [method add_do_property], [method add_undo_property], and [method commit_action] should be called one after the other, like in the example. Not doing so could lead to crashes.
            If you don't need to register a method you can leave [method add_do_method] and [method add_undo_method] out, and so it goes for properties. You can register more than one method/property.

            If [code]internal_port[/code] is [code]0[/code] (the default), the same port number is used for both the external and the internal port (the [code]port[/code] value).
            The description ([code]desc[/code]) is shown in some router UIs and can be used to point out which application added the mapping, and the lifetime of the mapping can be limited by [code]duration[/code]. However, some routers are incompatible with one or both of these, so use with caution and add fallback logic in case of errors to retry without them if in doubt.
            See [enum UPNPResult] for possible return values.

            UPNP device. See [UPNP] for UPNP discovery and utility functions. Provides low-level access to UPNP control commands. Allows to manage port mappings (port forwarding) and to query network information of the device (like local and external IP address and status). Note that methods on this class are synchronous and block the calling thread.

            This nodes implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. You will need to add a [CollisionShape] for the main body of your vehicle and add [VehicleWheel] nodes for the wheels. You should also add a [MeshInstance] to this node for the 3D model of your car but this model should not include meshes for the wheels. You should control the vehicle by using the [member brake], [member engine_force], and [member steering] properties and not change the position or orientation of this node directly.
            Note that the origin point of your VehicleBody will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle so it is better to keep this low and move the [CollisionShape] and [MeshInstance] upwards.

            A Viewport creates a different view into the screen, or a sub-view inside another viewport. Children 2D Nodes will display on it, and children Camera 3D nodes will render on it too.
            Optionally, a viewport can have its own 2D or 3D world, so they don't share what they draw with other viewports.
            If a viewport is a child of a [ViewportContainer], it will automatically take up its size, otherwise it must be set manually.
            Viewports can also choose to be audio listeners, so they generate positional audio depending on a 2D or 3D camera child of it.
            Also, viewports can be assigned to different screens in case the devices have multiple screens.
            Finally, viewports can also behave as render targets, in which case they will not be visible unless the associated texture is used to draw.

If this object is not a reference, weakref still works, however, it does not have any effect on the object. Weakrefs are useful in cases where multiple classes have variables that refer to each other. Without weakrefs, using these classes could lead to memory leaks, since both references keep each other from being released. Making part of the variables a weakref can prevent this cyclic dependency, and allows the references to be released.

            The [code]WorldEnvironment[/code] node is used to configure the default [Environment] for the scene.
            The parameters defined in the [code]WorldEnvironment[/code] can be overridden by an [Environment] node set on the current [Camera]. Additionally, only one [code]WorldEnvironment[/code] may be instanced in a given scene at a time.
            The [code]WorldEnvironment[/code] allows the user to specify default lighting parameters (e.g. ambient lighting), various post-processing effects (e.g. SSAO, DOF, Tonemapping), and how to draw the background (e.g. solid color, skybox). Usually, these are added in order to improve the realism/color balance of the scene.
